# robotframework
Just the latest robot framework on ubuntu 14.04.3.

You can use it as a base image whether you want to build your own image for firefox headless or whatnot, or simply to play around.

To drop into bash run:
docker run -ti --rm manycoding/robotframework

It'd nice to move from ubuntu to some cleaner image in future, such as debian.
